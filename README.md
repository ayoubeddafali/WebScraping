## Using beautifulSoup


I have created two table called : *Regions* & *Provinces*, in a manner that each region has many provinces.

With the help of **beautiflSoup** for webscraping and **pymysql** for interacting with the database, you could easily resolve this kind of problems when you need some data that it's not formatted the way you like.
